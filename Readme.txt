This is the workflow I have in place:

In order to create a Song, once a XML file has been loaded, the user can go to the Song toolbar and select "New Song" which will open a new
window with fields that apply to a Song that they may fill in.

In order to modify a Song, once a Song is selected, the user can go to the Song toolbar and select "Update Song" which will open a new window with the fields populated with what the selected Song has, that they may modify and save.

In order to add a Bar, once a Song is selected, the user can go to the Bar toolbar and select "Add Bar" which will open a new window with the fields that apply to a Bar that they may fill in.

In order to modify a Bar, the user can double click a Bar and a new window with fields populated with what that Bar had will open up, which the user can change and then save.

In order to delete a Bar, the user can double click a Bar and a new window with fields populated with what that Bar had will open up, and on this window the user can click the Delete button to delet the bar.

After all these actions the user should re-select a song and change tempo if need be.
